42 Piscine - C Projects
This repository contains the solutions to the exercises from the 42 Piscine, with the aim of learning and deepening knowledge in C in a practical way. Each directory corresponds to a set of exercises covering different topics, such as string manipulation, recursive programming, input/output operations, and even file manipulation in the shell.

What is 42?
42 is a programming school with a teaching model based on practical projects and collaborative learning. There are no teachers and no tuition fees. The "Piscine" (name given to the initial phase) is an intensive 4-week immersion, where students solve various exercises to develop technical skills and teamwork abilities. The focus is on learning by doing, without traditional classes, which allows students to acquire knowledge autonomously and focus on practical results.

How to Run the Exercises
Each directory contains the necessary files to run the exercises. To compile and execute the exercises, follow these steps:

Step 1: Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/spaderale/42_Piscine.git

Step 2: Navigate to the Exercise of Your Choice
For example, to access the ft_putchar exercise:
cd C00/Exercice_00

Step 3: Compile the Exercise
make

Step 4: Run the Program
./ft_putchar

Description of Functions and Concepts
This repository focuses on learning C through practical exercises involving:
String and Variable Manipulation: Functions like ft_strcpy, ft_strlen, ft_strcat, among others, for working with strings.
Recursion and Iteration: Functions like ft_recursive_factorial, ft_fibonacci, and ft_iterative_power to understand recursion concepts.
Input and Output Operations: Functions like ft_putchar, ft_putnbr for learning data output, and also ft_atoi for converting string input to numbers.
Shell Programming: Exercises exploring shell commands, like git commit, gitignore, and others.
